# VotingPresetPlugin – plan and tasks

One document: plan (command simplification, 30s reminder, early end) and implementation checklist.

---

## 1. Command simplification (plan)

**Before (old names, many aliases):** votetrack/vt/votepreset/vp/presetvote/pv, presetshow/currentpreset/currentrack, presetlist/presetget/presets, presetstartvote/presetvotestart, presetfinishvote/presetvotefinish, presetcancelvote/presetvotecancel/cancelvote, presetextendvote/presetvoteextend, presetset/presetchange/presetuse/presetupdate, presetrandom.

**After (single names, no aliases):**

| Old | New | Notes |
|-----|-----|--------|
| votetrack, vt, votepreset, vp, presetvote, pv | **/vote &lt;number&gt;** | Timer vote only: cast vote for option by that number. |
| presetshow, currentpreset, currentrack | **/preset** (no args) | Show **current preset only**. Include help: “Use /presets to list all presets.” Do **not** list votable presets. |
| presetlist, presetget, presets | **/presets** | List all presets (number + name). Include help: “Use /preset &lt;number&gt; to start a vote to switch to that preset.” |
| /preset &lt;number&gt; | **/preset &lt;number&gt;** | Unchanged. Start on-demand vote. |
| presetstartvote, presetvotestart | **/votestart** | Admin: start timer vote now. |
| presetfinishvote, presetvotefinish | **/voteend** | Admin: end timer vote and apply result. |
| presetcancelvote, presetvotecancel, cancelvote | **/votecancel** | Admin: cancel current vote (timer or on-demand). |
| presetextendvote, presetvoteextend | **/votetimeadd &lt;seconds&gt;** | Admin: add seconds to vote window. |
| presetset (drop presetchange, presetuse, presetupdate) | **/presetset** | Admin: set preset by index. No aliases. |
| presetrandom | **/presetrandom** | Admin: random other preset. Keep as is. |

**/yes** and **/no** (and **/y**, **/n**) unchanged for on-demand vote.

**Code change:** In `VotingPresetCommandModule.cs`, register only the new command names above. Remove all old aliases. Wire each new name to the existing plugin method (CountVote, GetPresetListAndHelp → preset no-args, ListAllPresets, StartVote, FinishVote, CancelVote/CancelOnDemandVote, ExtendVote, SetPreset, RandomPreset, VoteOnDemand).

**Behaviour change for /preset (no args):** Reply with current preset name only and “Use /presets to list all presets.” Do **not** include the list of votable presets with numbers. (Who can call /presets and whether players need to see numbers elsewhere is an implementation choice; see “Open point” below.)

---

## 2. On-demand vote: 30s reminder (plan)

**Current:** Reminder is sent every 30s from **vote start** (loop checks `(DateTime.UtcNow - lastReminder).TotalSeconds >= 30` and sets `lastReminder = DateTime.UtcNow` when sending). So it’s already “30s since last reminder” in code, but **we don’t broadcast when someone votes** — only a private reply to the voter. So the “last update” for everyone is only the previous reminder or the vote-start message.

**Target:** “30 seconds since the **last update**” — where “update” = any **broadcast** to all (vote start, or a status line with counts). So:
- When a player votes (**/yes** or **/no**), **broadcast** the current counts to everyone (e.g. “Yes: 2, No: 1, 45s left.”). That broadcast is the “last update”; reset the 30s reminder timer.
- Reminder logic: send the reminder only when `(now - lastBroadcastTime) >= 30` seconds. Update `lastBroadcastTime` whenever we broadcast (vote start, vote-count update, or the reminder itself).

**Implementation:** In `VoteOnDemand`, after updating counts, broadcast one line (time left + Yes/No counts). In `RunOnDemandVoteAsync`, maintain `lastBroadcastTime` (or equivalent): set it at vote start (when we broadcast “Vote to change to…”), set it when we broadcast from `VoteOnDemand`, and set it when we send the 30s reminder. Send reminder only when `(DateTime.UtcNow - lastBroadcastTime).TotalSeconds >= 30`.

---

## 3. On-demand vote: early end (plan)

**Target:** End the on-demand vote as soon as the result cannot change:
- **Yes wins early:** `yes_count > total_online / 2` (strict majority of connected players).
- **No wins early:** It is impossible for yes to reach majority even if all remaining players vote yes. With `remaining = total_online - yes_count - no_count`, that is when `yes_count + remaining <= total_online / 2`, i.e. when **no_count >= total_online / 2** (no already has half or more).

**Definition of total_online:** Use **connected cars count** (e.g. `_entryCarManager.ConnectedCars.Count`), i.e. everyone who could vote.

**Implementation:** In the on-demand loop (and/or when we process a vote in `VoteOnDemand`), after updating counts:
1. Compute `total_online`, `yes_count`, `no_count`, `remaining`.
2. If `yes_count > total_online / 2` → treat as yes won; exit loop, apply preset, set Idle.
3. If `no_count >= total_online / 2` → treat as no won; exit loop, apply cooldown, set Idle.
4. Otherwise continue until end time or next early-end check.

**Tie / exact half:** If we ever have `yes_count == no_count == total_online/2`, we can either end early as “no wins” (no change) or wait for timer; plan is to end when result is decided, so “no wins” when `no_count >= total_online/2` is consistent.

---

## 4. Resolved: /presets visibility

- **/presets** is available to all (RequireConnectedPlayer only). Players see votable presets with " /preset {i} - {Name}". Admins see that plus "Admin: set preset: /presetset &lt;number&gt;" and full list " /presetset {i} - {Name}". don’t see which **number** to use for **/preset &lt;number&gt;** unless we show votable numbers somewhere else (e.g. in **/preset** no-args, or in the on-demand vote start message). Options: (A) Make **/presets** available to all so everyone can see the list and the numbers, or (B) Keep **/presets** admin-only and add votable preset numbers (and names) to **/preset** no-args or to the “Vote to change to &lt;Name&gt;” message.
---

## 5. Implementation checklist

- [x] **Commands:** In `VotingPresetCommandModule.cs`, apply the mapping in section 1. Single name per command; remove all aliases. Rename handler references if needed (e.g. StartVote → still called from **votestart**).
- [x] **/preset (no args):** Change reply to current preset only + “Use /presets to list all presets.” No list of votable presets.
- [x] **/presets:** First line "To start a vote: /preset &lt;number&gt;"; each line " /preset {i} - {Name}". Admin-only unchanged (see open point). Ensure reply “Use /preset &lt;number&gt; to start a vote to switch to that preset.” Decide admin-only vs all (see open point).
- [x] **VoteOnDemand:** After recording a vote, **broadcast** one line with time left and Yes/No counts. Ensure this broadcast is used as “last update” for the 30s reminder.
- [x] **RunOnDemandVoteAsync:** Use “30s since last broadcast” for reminder: maintain last-broadcast time; set it at vote start and on every broadcast (vote update or reminder); send reminder only when ≥30s since last broadcast.
- [x] **Early end:** In on-demand loop (and optionally in VoteOnDemand after broadcast), check `yes_count > total_online/2` (yes wins) and `no_count >= total_online/2` (no wins). If either, exit loop and apply result (preset change or cooldown).
- [x] **Timer vote broadcast:** When broadcasting timer vote options, use **/vote &lt;number&gt;** in the text (e.g. “/vote 0 - Stay on current track”, “/vote 1 - &lt;Name&gt;”) instead of /vt.
- [x] **Docs:** README and this file are the only two; no new docs. (COMMANDS, STRUCTURE, AC_VOTE_SHORTCUTS merged or removed.)

### Backlog (not in §5 above)

- [ ] **§8 — First:** Lua vote UI foundation — two-way CSP **OnlineEvent** channel (see **§8, First**). Then §8.1–8.4 as needed.

---

## 6. Done / unchanged

- RequesterCooldownMinutes; one vote at a time (Idle | TimerVote | OnDemandVote); cooldown only after failed or canceled on-demand vote.
- Timer vote flow; on-demand start with /preset &lt;number&gt;; /yes, /no; auto-switch when only one other preset (no vote).
- Config in one file; single command module; single vote state in plugin.

---

## 7. Future / optional

- **Vote shortcuts / UI:** Chat-only history in **docs/WHY_CHAT_ONLY_NOT_SHORTCUTS.md**. **Concrete implementation path:** §8 **First** (CSP packets + Lua); keybinds/UI built on top of that channel.
- **PT-BR wording for players:** Add a pass to convert command-facing and status text to clearer Portuguese where desired (without breaking existing command names unless explicitly migrated).
- **/yes / /no ease-of-use:** Keep compatibility, but evaluate simpler player flow (clearer prompts, shorter reminders, optional aliases like `/sim` and `/nao` if approved).
- **Fake vote UI experiment:** Investigate if we can safely present native yes/no vote UI by emitting a synthetic vote type (session skip / kick-like packet flow) only as a frontend interaction layer for preset voting. Record protocol constraints and anti-abuse safeguards before any implementation.

## 8. Planned enhancements (backlog)

Backlog for behaviour **not** covered by §5. Same shape as §2–§3: **What**, **Why**, **How (technical)** — so we can implement later without re-deriving design.

**Implement §8 “First” before 8.1–8.4** unless priorities change (packet channel is prerequisite for Lua UI + keybinds).

**Overlap check (nothing below duplicates §2–§3 or §5):**  
§2–§3 and the checklist already cover 30s-since-broadcast reminders, broadcast on `/yes`/`/no`, early end, and `/vote` timer text. **§8 First** adds CSP **bidirectional** messages (not chat). **8.1–8.4** add: minimum turnout, session gating, change-vote, shared chat formatter (§7 “shortcuts” is intentionally vague; §8 First is the actionable slice).

### First: two-way VotingPresetPlugin ↔ client (Lua UI foundation)

**Goal:** (1) **Server → clients:** notify “preset/on-demand vote open — please vote” (payload: enough for UI; e.g. preset name, seconds left, vote kind). (2) **Client → server:** “I vote yes / no” (or timer option later) **without** the client sending session/car id for attribution — **handler uses `ACTcpClient` from the connection** (`ChatCommandContext.Client` pattern); packet body is only vote payload; spoofing another player’s id is therefore not applicable if we never accept id from Lua.

**Docs / patterns (read before coding):**
- **`docs/technical-docs/client-server-communication.md`:** OnlineEvent **hash** must match; **Lua** passes **`ac.SharedNamespace.ServerScript`** as the **third** argument to **`ac.OnlineEvent(...)`** — *Solution 1 (PenaltyReporterNoClip):* explicit ServerScript namespace so **client-installed** Lua hashes like **server-provided** script behavior; **field order** matches AssettoServer (primitives first, then strings); enable `DebugClientMessages` when hashing.
- **Client → server reference:** `mods/client-plugins/PenaltyReporterNoClip` (Lua → server handler).
- **Server → client reference:** `VotingPresetPlugin` already sends **`ReconnectClientPacket`** (`[OnlineEvent]` in `Preset/ReconnectClientPacket.cs`) via `BroadcastPacket`; mirror that pattern for a new outbound type (broadcast or targeted if API allows).
- **Server custom outbound elsewhere:** e.g. `CollisionPenaltiesPlugin/Packets/ThrottlePenaltyPacket.cs` (server → client); same OnlineEvent registration/send patterns as other plugins.

**Quick implementation talklist:**
- [ ] Define **C#** `OnlineEvent` types (minimal fields): e.g. `VotingPresetVoteOpenPacket` (server→client), `VotingPresetVoteCastPacket` (client→server: `bool isYes` or `byte choice`).
- [ ] Register **incoming** handler in plugin (same mechanism as CollisionPenalties / CSP client message dispatch — follow existing `OnlineEvent` consumer in codebase).
- [ ] On on-demand **start** / updates / end (and optionally timer vote start): `BroadcastPacket` or per-car send the open/status packet **in addition to** existing chat (chat stays fallback until UI is universal).
- [ ] **Lua** (new or extended app): register receiver with **matching** layout + `ac.SharedNamespace.ServerScript`; on keybind send cast packet with **no** identity field.
- [ ] Wire handler to **existing** `VoteOnDemand` / `CountVote` logic (same rules as `/yes` `/no` — one code path, chat and packet are two inputs).
- [ ] Verify hashes in logs; document final structure string in this file or README one-liner when stable.

### 8.1 Minimum participation (e.g. ≥25% of players online)

**What:** Before applying a **winning** on-demand result (and optionally before applying a timer vote winner), require enough **distinct voters**. Example rule: `participated >= ceil(0.25 * total_online)`, with `total_online = _entryCarManager.ConnectedCars.Count` (same population as early-end in §3). If the vote would have passed on yes/no counts but participation is below threshold, treat as **failed**: preset unchanged; decide whether requester gets `RequesterCooldownMinutes` (policy — document in config comment).

**Why:** Stops a single auto-yes (starter) or a tiny clique from changing track on a full server when most people never voted.

**How:** Add config (e.g. `MinParticipationPercent` 0–100, default 0 = current behaviour). At end of `RunOnDemandVoteAsync`: if `yes > no` but `participated < required`, skip `SetPreset`, broadcast reason. Math: `required = max(1, (int)Math.Ceiling(total * percent / 100.0))` unless you explicitly want “0 voters allowed” when percent is 0. For **timer votes**, after `WaitVoting` in `VotingAsync`: if winner has votes but `_alreadyVoted.Count < required`, treat like “stay on track” or “vote failed” (product choice). Edge: AFK cars inflate `total_online` — acceptable if we use the same definition as §3.

### 8.2 Block votes during Race session (Practice / Qualifying only)

**What:** Refuse to **start** timer votes (interval + `/votestart`) and refuse `/preset <number>` on-demand votes while the session is in **Race**. Allow during Practice, Qualifying, and any non-race phase the game exposes (exact enum TBD).

**Why:** Preset changes mid-race are disruptive; practice/qualifying are natural windows.

**How:** Locate in `AssettoServer` the authoritative **session / phase** (naming varies: search for session state, race start, lap counter). Inject that into `VotingPresetPlugin` or read from a small facade. Guard at: `StartOnDemandVote` (reply to requester), `VotingAsync` / `ExecuteAsync` before opening vote, `StartVote` (admin). Return a single clear chat line, e.g. “Preset votes are disabled during the race.” Optional YAML: `DisallowVotesDuringRace: true`. If API only exposes “in race” boolean, map other states to “allowed” by default.

### 8.3 On-demand: remember choice per client; allow changing vote

**What:** Today `_onDemandVoted` is `List<ACTcpClient>` and `VoteOnDemand` rejects a second `/yes` or `/no` with “You voted already.” Replace with **`Dictionary<ACTcpClient, bool>`** (yes=true, no=false) or a tiny enum. On a new vote from the same client, **adjust counts**: decrement previous bucket, increment new bucket, update map entry.

**Why:** Better than a boolean list alone; enables UX “I changed my mind”; optional future: show tallies by name (not required for v1).

**How:** Refactor `VoteOnDemand`; keep early-end logic (`yes_count`, `no_count`, `total`) unchanged except counts must stay consistent when switching. Clear map on vote end/cancel. **Timer vote path** uses `_alreadyVoted` + `_availablePresets[i].Votes` — for change-vote there, use `Dictionary<ACTcpClient, int>` (option index) and on change decrement old option’s votes, increment new; same double-vote guard becomes “update” path.

### 8.4 One formatter for on-demand status text (broadcast vs private)

**What:** Vote **start** uses `BroadcastChat` with `"Change to {Name}? /yes /no ..."`; `GetPresetListAndHelp` (during on-demand) uses `context.Reply` with a similar line but **remaining seconds** and live counts. They are **not** duplicates for different audiences: start is **public**, help is **private** to whoever typed `/preset` with no args — but the **wording drifts** and two places must be edited for i18n or clarity.

**Why:** Single `FormatOnDemandStatus(...)` (or local function) avoids inconsistent messages; optional parameter `forBroadcast: bool` if we ever need a shorter line for chat limits.

**How:** Method parameters e.g. `presetName`, `secondsLeft`, `yes`, `no`, `abstained`. Call from `StartOnDemandVote` (pass `VotingDurationSeconds` as initial `secondsLeft` or compute from `_onDemandEndTime`), `VoteOnDemand`, `RunOnDemandVoteAsync` reminder, and `GetPresetListAndHelp`. Do **not** remove public vs private routing — only unify the **string template**.
